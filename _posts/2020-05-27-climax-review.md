You may know, or at least heard, what an acid trip is. But, do you know what it *really* feels like if you take it for real? Well, Climax will show you how it is.

Climax is a story that based on a true event about a dance troupe doing an after-party after a dance rehearsal. However, things went south after all of them drink a drug-laced sangria (an alcoholic beverage from Spain). The nightmare begins.

It opens with a woman dragging her bloody body in the snow while screaming in agony. Then, the credit rolls. From this opening itself we know right away, that we will witness something weird.

We get to know the characters by watching an interview on an old television set. One by one tells their story and answer the given questions. It's honestly boring. But I guess it is necessary.

It takes off a bit when the absolutely amazing five minutes dance sequence starts. Hats off to the choreographer, because that dance is straight fire. It looks unorganized at first, but then their moves flow beautifully. A chaotic order.

The film slows down a little with the characters having a conversation. It jumps from one conversation to the other. Although it disrupts the flow, these conversations reveal the nature of each character.

Right after halfway through the movie, we are introduced to the root cause of the yet-to-come nightmare; sangria. And it starts with a piss. A literal piss. When one of them urinate on the dance floor, Selva—played by Sofia Boutella—begins to notice something weird going on. Turns out, the sangria has been laced with acid. So, all hell breaks loose.

Gaspar Noe, the director, uses one uninterrupted long take to invite us to experience the hallucinatory trip of each character. The camera follows one character to the other. With this long take, we witnesses their descend into madness. I can't even describe how it is. It is pure chaos. When the light turns red, it's just more disturbing. It looks like hell has bestowed upon them and us.

In the climax, with all kinds of horrible things happens on the dance floor, the camera turns upside down. It lingers on all characters that doing questionable behavior. We see the state of all the dancer after the nightmare ends. And it ends badly.

The decision to use long take in nearly the entire course of the film is absolutely paid off. It manages to show the horror of hallucination and paranoia that LSD created without displaying what the character is actually experiencing in their head.

This movie is certainly divisive. It is not for everyone. I may not love it, but it is definitely an intriguing and unforgettable viewing experience.
