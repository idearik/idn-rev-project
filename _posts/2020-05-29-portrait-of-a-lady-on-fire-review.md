I'm not a person that usually watches a drama/romance film. But this, ladies and gentleman, is just something that can't be missed. This is a film that fits with what Scorsese called "Cinema."

Portrait of a Lady on Fire, sets in France in 1770, tells a story about Marianne, a painter, that asked to create a wedding portrait of Héloïse, a woman that just left a convent. However, she has to paint Héloïse secretly. In this painting process, Marianne that observes Héloïse everyday, slowly fall in love with her. And so does she. Unfortunately, it does not end on a hppy note.

Noémie Merlant and Adèle Haenel gives an outstanding performance in here. Their chemistry here is through the roof. We can feel the intimacy and warmness of their relationship throughout the course of the film. Although only one of them is a part of LGBTQ community, these two portrays the romance between two characters extraordinarily.

There is a scene between them when Héloïse strike a pose and Marianne paint her, they are smiling and grinning at each other. I can't help but also smile watching it. It feels natural and authentic.

In terms of how the film looks, it's absolutely beautiful. A combination of wonderful location and great cinematography is a sight to behold. There are a few scenes that looks like it taken straight out of a real panting. The used of flat color palette is also give a sense of tranquility, which I love.

The decision of Céline Sciamma, the director, to use the ambience and surrounding sound in almost the entire film is really effective. The lack of score and music makes it more engaging. We can sense every little things that happen and it immerses us into the 18th century. But when there is a music, it happens in a suitable moment. There are three occasions when a music being used. The first one is when Marianne play "Summer" from Vivaldi's Four Seasons in piano. And then the haunting yet beautiful song sings by group of women in the bonfire scene. The third one is the same song with the first one at the end of the film.

And speaking of the end of film, let's talk about the ending. What a wonderful way to end a film. After they go different ways, we see two of them in the same room, but sat opposite each other. Marianne sees Héloïse, but not the other way around. Héloïse see the concert that play the same music Marianne played before. She cries, remembering their time together. We expects her to see Marianne, but she does not. To end a film like that is powerful. And unexpected—to me, at least.
