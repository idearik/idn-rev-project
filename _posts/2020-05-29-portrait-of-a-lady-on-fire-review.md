I'm not a person that usually watches a drama/romance film. But this, ladies and gentlemen, is just something that can't be missed. This is a film that fits with what Scorsese called "Cinema." 

Portrait of a Lady on Fire, sets in France in 1770, tells a story about Marianne, a painter, that asked to create a wedding portrait of Héloïse, a woman that just left a convent. However, she has to paint Héloïse secretly. In this painting process, Marianne that observes Héloïse every day, slowly falls in love with her. And so does she. Unfortunately, it does not end on a happy note.

Noémie Merlant and Adèle Haenel give an outstanding performance in here. Their chemistry here is through the roof. We can feel the intimacy and warmness of their relationship throughout the film. Although only one of them is a part of the LGBTQ community, these two portrays the romance between two characters extraordinarily.

There is a scene between them when Héloïse strikes a pose and Marianne paint her, they are smiling and grinning at each other. I can't help but also smile watching it. It feels natural and authentic.

In terms of how the film looks, it's absolutely beautiful. A combination of wonderful location and great cinematography is a sight to behold. There are a few scenes that look like it taken straight out of a real panting. The use of flat color palette is also give a sense of tranquility, which I love.

The decision of Céline Sciamma, the director, to use the ambiance and surrounding sound in almost the entire film is really effective. The lack of score and music makes it more engaging. We can sense every little thing that happens and it immerses us into the 18th century. But when there is music, it happens in a suitable moment. There are three occasions when a piece of music being used. The first one is when Marianne plays "Summer" from Vivaldi's Four Seasons in piano. And then the haunting yet beautiful song sings by a group of women in the bonfire scene. The third one is the same song as the first one at the end of the film. 

And speaking of the end of the film, let's talk about the ending. What a wonderful way to end a film. After they go in different ways, we see two of them in the same room, but sat opposite each other. Marianne sees Héloïse, but not the other way around. Héloïse sees the concert that plays the same music Marianne played before. She cries, remembering their time together. We expect her to see Marianne, but she does not. To end a film like that is powerful. And unexpected—to me, at least.
