I know I’m a bit late watching this movie, but boy do I regret it. No, not because it’s bad. Far from it. It turns out to be really amazing. It's Tarantino at the top of his game!

Inglourious Basterds is an alternate history of WWII that tell a group of Jewish U.S. soldiers plans to assassinate Nazi leaders by burning down the the theater that hold the German movie premiere event to end the war. Turns out, a Jewish woman that seek revenge of her killed family also has the same plan as them.

As any previous Quentin Tarantino movies, the writing is what made this movie so great. His trademark's witty, clever and well-written dialogues are very apparent—as always. Divided into five chapters and runs 153 minutes, it doesn't feel long and dragged. It is perfectly paced. Quentin knows when he move the story fast, or when he has to deliberately slows the tempo.

That slow tempo is show directly on the opening scene. It consists of only conversation between Hans Landa and LaPadite in a room. Although it's only a dialogue, it is as intense and interesting as any action scene. It's masterful writing from Tarantino. The directing is also help that exceptional scene by using close up shot that makes it so gripping to us the audience.

The good directing does not stop there. There are a lot of beautiful shot and excellent camera work throughout the film. For example, the scene in the second chapter when Aldo Raine asks the German soldier to show the location of his fellow soldiers on the map. Rather than use the usual shot reverse shot Another example would be the conversation scene between Hans Landa and Bridget von Hammersmark. The camera circling around them while they speak, make us the viewer feel the nerves of Bridget.
