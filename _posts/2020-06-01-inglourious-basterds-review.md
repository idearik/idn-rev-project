I know I’m a bit late watching this movie, but boy do I regret it. No, not because it’s bad. Far from it. It turns out to be really amazing. It's Tarantino at the top of his game!

Inglourious Basterds is an alternate history of WWII that tells a group of Jewish U.S. soldiers plans to assassinate Nazi leaders by burning down the theater that holds the German movie premiere event to end the war. Turns out, a Jewish woman that seeks revenge for her killed family also has the same plan as them.

Like any previous Quentin Tarantino movies, the writing is what made this movie so great. His trademark's witty, clever and well-written dialogues are very apparent—as always. Divided into five chapters and runs 153 minutes, it doesn't feel long and dragged. It is perfectly paced. Quentin knows when he has to move the story faster, or when he has to deliberately slows the tempo.

That slow tempo is shown right away on the opening scene. It consists of only a conversation between Hans Landa and LaPadite in a room. Although it's only dialogue, it is as intense and interesting as any action scene. It's masterful writing from Tarantino. The directing is also helps that exceptional scene by using a close-up shot that makes it so gripping to us the audience.

The outstanding direction does not stop there. There are a lot of beautiful shots and excellent camera works throughout the film. For example, the scene in the second chapter when Aldo Raine asks the German soldier to show the location of his fellow soldiers on the map. Rather than using the usual wide shot or close up shot of each character, Tarantino and his cinematographer Robert Richardson just use one camera and move the camera as three characters speak, shifting over them. Another example would be the conversation scene between Hans Landa and Bridget von Hammersmark. The camera circling them while they speak, make us the viewer feel the nerves of Bridget.

There is also neat camera angle used here. Two characters facing down while the camera on the ground facing upward. It's as if the characters on the screen looking at us. It happens twice, on the second chapter and right at the end. And these scenes happen to be the most well-known and iconic shot of this film.

Other than that, there is one thing that makes this film as great as it is—the performances. Every cast plays their role spectacularly. But there is one performance that stands out the most. Christopher Waltz, as Colonel Hans Landa, is just tremendous. He absolutely nailed it. He gives a menacing yet charming performance. Every time he's on screen, he draws your attention with his appealing appearance. And he also switches between three languages (France, Italian, and English) at ease!

To top it all off, we have been blessed with an amazing last 10 minutes. That is just glorious. It's basically the great massacre of a bunch of Nazis. We get to witness Hitler getting shot, repeatedly. And then the theater full of Nazi being burned down while the face of Shosanna Dreyfus—a Jewish woman, plays by Mélanie Laurent, laughing in the background is fantastic.

Although I haven't watched all Tarantino's films—which I should've, I can safely say that this, by far, his best film for me. I enjoyed and loved every minute of it. A brilliant and entertaining cinema.

And as Lt. Aldo Raine said at the end, which I believe Quentin Tarantino being meta about this film, "I think this just might be my masterpiece."
