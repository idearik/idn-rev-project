This is a sport film about **J.B Bernstein (JB)**. Some people may disagree with the term "sport film" for this one but it also too "technical" to be a biography, so... Let's just called it "sport film" for the sake of simplicity.

Million Dollar Arm is a story about reality show called "The Million Dollar Arm" on Indian Zee TV. The winner of this show will receive $100,000 and opportunity to win ONE MILLION DOLLAR (USD) on the bonus round. It's should be called "1.1 MILLION DOLLAR ARM" instead.

The story begin with the failure of JB to signed an American Football rising star to his agency. Then, after talked to his new investor, he pitched new idea about finding potential baseball players in India, one of the largest country on Earth.

His new investor give him one year...

**It's an impossible task.** So, JB, like a smart businessman he is, decline that offer.

Oh... Actually JB said "YES", going to India and maybe regret his choices by the time he see the wonderful traffic of India.

But, this is an "inspirational" movie from Disney. Everything should be OK in the end. JB found his new players, Rinku Singh and Dinesh Patel, flew them to the US, train them with the best coach, help them signed with professional teams and live happily ever after.

No?

JB still can't move on from his "American Football rising star" deal, he forgot about two young men that he took from India, so they fucked up during test in front of coaches of baseball professional team. But, one girl (his neighbor) made him remember Rinku and Dinesh.

Long story short, Rinku, Dinesh and JB get their second chances and live happily ever after.

## Review of Million Dollar Arm

### Just Another Forgetful Movie from Disney

Disney doesn't always created masterpiece. There are some class-B movie that actually have super good premise like this movie, but the script just not that good.

Personally, I love the main story; a man finally realize his mistakes and make it right.

But, the movie feel so bland. Maybe more drama or more action during the pitch can help.

**Fun Fact:** Did you know that Rinku Singh is now a professional wrestler for WWE? Here's a picture of him.
