Do you ever get an anxiety attack and feel stressed out in your life? I bet you are. But, do you ever experience it when you watch a movie? Well, you’re in for a treat. Because Uncut Gems will do exactly that to you.

Uncut Gems is a story about Howard Ratner, a charismatic jeweler that addicted to gambling began to experience his downfall. With all things that seems like it goes in the wrong way, he placed an ultimate bet to try to fix his life.

As I said before, this is an anxiety-inducing film. You feel every misstep, every rejection, every fed-up, and every nerve-wracking situation. This stressful feeling is the result of the immaculate direction from Safdie Brothers and cinematographer Darius Khondji. Those close-up shots just amplify the anxiousness of us the viewers. All that intense and suspenseful scenes are masterfully crafted by them, especially whenever we see Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler) in almost throughout the film. Few examples are when he’s being chased and harassed by debt-collector, when he was trapped in the trunk of his car, and then in the end–especially that ending, which I will talk about it later.

The soul of this movie lay on none other than Adam Sandler. He gives the performance of his life here. He shows the anxiousness, over-confidence, and vulnerability of Howard Ratner. You may know him by his bunch of mostly-trash comedy films. However, when you give him a serious role like this, he nailed it! Just watch Paul Thomas Anderson’s Punch-Drunk Love, he’s absolutely amazing in there.

There is one other cast that absolutely good in every scene she’s in. Yes, she is the goddess Julia Fox. She did a stellar job as Julia De Fiore–a clerk jewelry/Howard’s girlfriend, considering this is her first acting job. The fight between her and Howard in front of the club is worthy of praise. That, and her magnificent figure that we can see in that you-know-what scene.

Can I just talk about the ending now? Because boy, if that’s not the most anxious, stressed, and nail-biting experience you can find in any film, I don’t know what is. With that constant overlapping dialogues, quick cut between characters, and thumping scores, keeps me at the edge of my seat! When you thought that it will end on a happy note, then it hits you with a shocking and bloody finale. And it’s ironically a fitting end for Howard Ratner.

That being said, what an experience. While I enjoy every minute of it, I don’t think it’s for everyone, especially if you want to seek pleasure and laughter (Although it can be funny on a few occasions). All in all, it’s a worth watching piece of cinema. And an absolute must-see film if you somehow wanna have anxiety and feel uncomfortable, in a good way.
